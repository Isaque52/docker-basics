# docker-basics

Included in this repo are a variety of folders that will show you "how" docker works as well as
some brief setup guides to test and have a play with your own mini-sandbox environment

## Types of training

### MVP - Plain Dockerfile

This will instantiate your own version of a "hello world" style docker environment. Here we will
create our own docker image, using `Dockerfile` and then run it using some commands.

Because this is designed to be a true MVP, there will be no direct inheritance (Which is not that
common), and as such we will have little to no ability to perform tasks.
