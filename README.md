# docker-basics

Included in this repo are a variety of folders that will show you "how" docker works as well as
some brief setup guides to test and have a play with your own mini-sandbox environment

## Types of training

### MVP - Plain Dockerfile

This will instantiate your own version of a "hello world" style docker environment. Here we will
create our own docker image, using `Dockerfile` and then run it using some commands.

Whilst this is designed to be an MVP, there will be some direct inheritance (Which is quite common),
and in most projects will inherit from a base programming language such as ruby.
